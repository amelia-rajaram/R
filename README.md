# Economics Capstone Project

## Overview
This project represents my Economics Capstone, where our team conducted a regression analysis to understand the infrastructure spending differences within the United States. Specifically, I worked on the median age and average temperature variables using R to provide informed recommendations and policy decisions.

## Dataset and forecasts on infrastructure spending.i
The dataset used in this project is derived from the US Bank and the Census Bureau. Some of the key variables analyzed include:

- Median Age
- Average Temperature
- Average Income
- Capital Outlay per Capita
- Population Density
- Total Captal Outlay by State

## Tools Used
- R
- RStudio
- Excel
- Stata

## Analysis and Methodology

The project involved the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning and Processing**:
   - Checked for and removed duplicates.
   - Handled missing values. 
   - Verified and corrected inconsistencies in the data.
   
2. **Regression Analysis**:
   - Conducted regression analysis using R and Stata to analyze the relationship between median age, average temperature, and infrastructure spending.

3. **Visualization and Reporting**:
   - Created visualizations to identify spending patterns and trends.
   - Developed an infographic summarizing key findings and insights.
   - Compiled a comprehensive report detailing the methodology, analysis, and conclusions.

## Key Findings

- **Median Age**: A significant relationship was found between the median age of a population and infrastructure spending per capita.
- **Average Temperature**: Regions with extreme temperatures tend to have higher infrastructure spending to cope with climate challenges.
- **Average Income**: Higher average income levels are positively correlated with greater infrastructure spending.
- **Population Density**: More densely populated areas required higher infrastructure spending to support the population.
- **Capital Outlay**: States with higher per capita outlay demonstrate a greater capacity for infrastructure development, reflecting diverse fiscal priorities and capacities.
