# Economics Capstone Project

## Overview
This project represents my Economics Capstone, where our team conducted a regression analysis to understand the infrastructure spending differences within the United States. Our goal was to provide recommendations on how to better improve the overall distribution of spending. Specifically, I worked on the median age and average temperature variables using R and RStudio to create the regression analysis.
